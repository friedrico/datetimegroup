A plasmoid for those who are (or want to begin) using date time groups (e.g. for NATO or armed forces or fun or whatever reason).

Following things are to do
(feel free to add suggestions)
- background color (or picture) (I don't find it very useful)
- clean up and comment the code (see above)
- translate config dialogs (yeah, I really should do it...)

To install just execute install.sh - but you have to execute kbuildsycoca4 and restart plasma-desktop to use it.
